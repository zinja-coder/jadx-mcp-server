## ü§ñ What is JADX-MCP-SERVER?

**JADX MCP Server** is a standalone Python server that interacts with a modified version of `jadx-gui` (see: [jadx-ai-mcp](https://github.com/zinja-coder/jadx-ai-mcp)) via MCP (Model Context Protocol). It lets LLMs communicate with the decompiled Android app context live.


## ü§ñ What is JADX-AI-MCP?

**JADX-AI-MCP** is a plugin for the [JADX decompiler](https://github.com/skylot/jadx) that integrates directly with [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://github.com/anthropic/mcp) to provide **live reverse engineering support with LLMs like Claude**.

Think: "Decompile ‚Üí Context-Aware Code Review ‚Üí AI Recommendations" ‚Äî all in real time.

## üõ£Ô∏è Future Roadmap

- [x] Add Support for apktool

 - [ ] Add support for hermes code (ReactNative Application)

 - [ ] Add more useful MCP Tools

 - [ ] Make LLM be able to modify code on JADX

 - [ ] Add prompts templates, give llm access to Android APK Files as Resources

 - [ ] Build MCP Client to support Local LLM

 - [ ] **END-GOAL** : Make all android reverse engineering and APK modification tools Connect with single MCP server to make reverse engineering apk files as easy as possible purely from vibes.

## üôè Credits

This project is a plugin for JADX, an amazing open-source Android decompiler created and maintained by [@skylot](https://github.com/skylot). All core decompilation logic belongs to them. I have only extended it to support my MCP server with AI capabilities.

[üìé Original README (JADX)](https://github.com/skylot/jadx)

The original README.md from jadx is included here in this repository for reference and credit.

This MCP server is made possible by the extensibility of JADX-GUI and the amazing Android reverse engineering community.

Also huge thanks to [@aaddrick](https://github.com/aaddrick) for developing Claude desktop for Debian based linux.

And in last thanks to [@anthropics](https://github.com/anthropics) for developing the Model Context Protocol and [@FastMCP](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk) team

And all open source maintainers and contributors that makes libraries and dependencies which allows project like this possible.
